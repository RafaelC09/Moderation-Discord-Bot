# Overview

SimpleDiscordBOT is a modular Discord moderation bot built with Python using the discord.py library. The bot is designed for easy scalability and readability, using Cogs (extensions) to separate functionality.

[Installation](#installation) of python.py is easy!

# Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- discord.py(v2.3+)
- asyncio

# Installation

**To install you need to access this link:**

- [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
- `pip install asyncio`

# Features

Like already said, this is a moderation bot, so it has some features that you can use(you can use !helpcmd in discord to see the commands):

- count
- chnick
- clean
- ban
- unban
- kick
- warn
- ticket
- close

# Notes

I added some notes on the files .py for things that you require to put from your discord like your BOT TOKEN and in the .json file you need to add your server ID. For that you need to join Developer Mode in Discord Configs and Copy ID in your server.
